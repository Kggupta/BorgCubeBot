This bot is really just a fun project that I'm doing as a hobby and to interact with my friends. I plan on making it an all-in-one bot, themed after the popular Star Trek villain known only as "The Borg".

Join the [bot server](https://discord.gg/evYQA2h) if you would like to help with beta-testing!
[upvote](https://discordbots.org/bot/518206536535769099/vote) the bot if you like what you see!
[invite](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=518206536535769099&permissions=2080762993&scope=bot) the bot to your server and join the fun! (Needs Administrator permissions to use the Moderation commands)

The features I will add to it are as follows, but not limited to:
- Moderation
  - ~~Kick~~
  - ~~Ban~~
  - ~~Mute~~
  - ~~Mass delete messages~~
  - Color Roles
  - Warning system
- RPG
  - Explore strange new worlds right from your discord account by finding and claiming planets as your own
  - Trade planets between players
  - Go on group explorations to find solar systems
  - Befriend other species to get a constant stream of credits (passive income)
  - Level up to increase the awesomeness of your ship
    - The best ship becomes the federations 'flagship' much like the USS enterprise
  - Choose your species (human, vulcan, klingon, ferengi, etc) and gain skills based on your species
- Convenience
  - ~~Use animated emotes without needing to buy nitro~~
  - Search images, ~~videos~~, google all from a command
