# BorgCubeBot


This bot is really just a fun project that im doing as a hobby and to interact with my friends. Although it is limited in capabilities at the moment, I plan on making it an all-in-one bot, themed after the popular Star Trek villain known only as "The Borg".

The features I will add to it are as follows, but not limited to:
- Economy
  - ~~A currency system called 'Federation Credits'~~
  - ~~Gambling fake money~~
  - ~~Gain money by being active in the server~~
  - ~~Transfer money between players~~
  - Buy items
- Moderation
  - ~~Kick~~
  - ~~Ban~~
  - ~~Mute~~
  - Color Roles
  - Warning system
- RPG
  - Explore strange new worlds right from your discord account by finding and claiming planets as your own
  - Trade planets between players
  - Go on group explorations to find solar systems
  - Befriend other species to get a constant stream of credits (passive income)
  - Level up to increase the awesomeness of your ship
    - The best ship becomes the federations 'flagship' much like the USS enterprise
  - Choose your species (human, vulcan, klingon, ferengi, etc) and gain skills based on your species
- Convenience
  - Search images, ~~videos~~, google all from a command
  - Create roles using a command
  - Create channels with a command
  - Adjust member permissions through a command
- Fun
  - Meme making
